Implementation of random binning encoding and secrecy rate evaluation

Report: https://www.overleaf.com/project/5fc0df68dfa390e0124a9965

### Log for security metrics to put in the report:
- 2.3.1: run task1_simulate_wiretap.m and plot the output
- 2.3.2: run task4_simulate_Z and plot each column separately
- 2.3.3: I(u;z) is the output of task4_mutualinfo.m
- 2.3.4-6: todo

### Log for "Considerations and remarks"
If the reasoning is correct, h<sub>2</sub>(ε)=0.36, h<sub>2</sub>(ε)=0.75.

Therefore C<sub>s</sub>≈0.4, for the full message (7) it's 2.8 ≈ 3 secret bits.
